## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chenyijennifer/hometown-page.git

## Lessons Learned:

By making this simple webpage, I practiced and displayed what I've learned about HTML and CSS. The project was inspired by a course called Learn HTML and CSS on Scrimba. I found myself being more familiar with those basic techniques, including flexbox, background color gradient, ids and classes... just to name a few, in order to build a better page.
